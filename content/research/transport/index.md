## New transport, urban design, and health
We take new metros as the interventions, using natural experiment studies to infer causal effects on active travel, wider health behaviours, and economic outcomes.



### Research Objectives

- Define new metro as a complex intervention 
- Discover natural experiments to infer causal effects on health and social outcomes
- Value the urban design in the metro station areas
- Investigate China's metro development model from home to abroad
- Modelling of volumetric development in high-density citie

### Ongoing Research
- Land policy, housing, and transport infrastructure provision
- Methodologies for assessing volumetric urban designs of metro infrastructure projects in the Greater Bay Area
- Pricing urban design in metro station areas
- Volumetric development, housing price, TOD
- Public transport use, social inclusion and wellbeing of older people

### Completed Work
- Metro and elderly health
- How do older people access public transport in high-density cities?
- Shenzhenâ€™s urban rail transit project in Addis Ababa
- Walking environment around metro stations
- Assessing planned transport infrastructure in Pakistan
