title: Transport
summary: We are investigating street experiments that bridge mobility and public space to look at how short-term actions lead to long-term changes.
subtitle: We take new metros as the interventions, using natural experiment studies to infer causal effects on active travel, wider health behaviours, and economic outcomes.

## New transport, urban design, and health

### Research Objectives

- Define new metro as a complex intervention 
- Discover natural experiments to infer causal effects on health and social outcomes
- Value the urban design in the metro station areas
- Investigate China's metro development model from home to abroad
- Modelling of volumetric development in high-density citie

### Ongoing Research
- [Land policy, housing, and transport infrastructure provision] ({{< ref "/project/land-policy/index" >}} "an ongoing transport research")
- [Methodologies for assessing volumetric urban designs of metro infrastructure projects in the Greater Bay Area methodologies-assessing] ({{< ref "/project/methodologies-assessing/index" >}} "an ongoing transport research")
- [Pricing urban design in metro station areas] ({{< ref "/project/pricing-urban-design/index" >}} "an ongoing transport research")
- [Volumetric development, housing price, TOD] ({{< ref "/project/volumetric-development/index" >}} "an ongoing transport research")
- [Public transport use, social inclusion and wellbeing of older people] ({{< ref "/project/public-transport/index" >}} "an ongoing transport research")

### Completed Work
- Metro and elderly health
- How do older people access public transport in high-density cities?
- Shenzhenâ€™s urban rail transit project in Addis Ababa
- Walking environment around metro stations
- Assessing planned transport infrastructure in Pakistan
