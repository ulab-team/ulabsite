title: Transport
summary: We are investigating street experiments that bridge mobility and public space to look at how short-term actions lead to long-term changes.
subtitle: We take new metros as the interventions, using natural experiment studies to infer causal effects on active travel, wider health behaviours, and economic outcomes.

## New transport, urban design, and health

### Research Objectives

- Define new metro as a complex intervention 
- Discover natural experiments to infer causal effects on health and social outcomes
- Value the urban design in the metro station areas
- Investigate China's metro development model from home to abroad
- Modelling of volumetric development in high-density citie

### Ongoing Research
