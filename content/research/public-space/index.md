## Street, public space and their experiments

We are investigating the street experiments that bridge the mobility and public space functions, to look at how short-term actions lead to long-term changes. Our engagements include experiments and design studios in the communities. 

### Research Objectives

- Randomised controlled experiments on greenery and health
- Investigate the relationship between short-term actions and long-term changes on streets
- Understand the street design code in high-density cities
- Investigate how accurate data empower urban analytics 
- Participate the place-making in street and open spaces
- Study methods to provide the blue and green infrastructure through social innovation


### Ongoing Research

- Global street experiments: Short-term actions to long-term changes
- Privately owned public space, interior urbanism, Hong Kong
- Tactical urbanism in Asian high-density cities

### Completed Work
- Walkability scoring in high-density cities
- 3D pedestrian network of Hong Kong
