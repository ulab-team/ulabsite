## Housing, social, and health effects

We are particularly interested in urban redevelopment in high-density cities and use the changes in housing and neighbourhoods as complex interventions to investigate the longitudinal effects on the mental health and wellbeing of the residents.

### Research Objectives

- Understand the urban renewal process 
- Discover experiments to infer longitudinal effects on health and social outcomes
- Healthy urban rehabilitation through social innovation
- Use substantive knowledge to strengthen the natural experiment research design
- Investigating the double ageing issue in high density cities
