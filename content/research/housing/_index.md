        ## Housing, social, and health effects

        We are particularly interested in urban redevelopment in high-density cities and use the changes in housing and neighbourhoods as complex interventions to investigate the longitudinal effects on the mental health and wellbeing of the residents.

        ### Research Objectives

        - Understand the urban renewal process 
        - Discover experiments to infer longitudinal effects on health and social outcomes
        - Healthy urban rehabilitation through social innovation
        - Use substantive knowledge to strengthen the natural experiment research design
        - Investigating the double ageing issue in high density cities
