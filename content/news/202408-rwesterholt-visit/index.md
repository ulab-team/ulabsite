Jun.-Prof. René Westerholt spent two weeks as a guest at our lab. One aim of the visit was to develop a joint paper on tactical urbanism further. In addition, René gave a public lecture on methodological aspects of spatial statistical analyses of everyday geographies and held personal consultations with many doctoral and postdoctoral students for professional and career-oriented advice. The research also strengthened relations between RAM and the Urban Analytics and Interventions Research Lab. Both institutions have maintained an intensive exchange over the past few years, which has led, in particular, to the realisation of a joint DAAD research project, including research visits to Dortmund and Hong Kong.
