I am an Assistant Professor and the founding director of Urban Analytics and Interventions Research Lab at the University of Hong Kong. My research interests in urban development and sustainability lie at the interfaces of urban planning, land policy, transportation, and public health. The social, economic and health impacts of large-scale interventions, such as new metro infrastructure, urban renewal, large-block gated communities, and global street experiments, are profound. I specialise in using natural experiments to infer the causality of such impacts. I am also interested in the institution and governance of the infrastructure provisions, using experimental economics approaches to formulating the decision-making processes in local governments.

My research establishes essential urban data, new methodologies, and causal evidence to extend the scientific understanding of the institutions and outcomes of large-scale interventions, contributing to healthy, equitable, and sustainable cities. My work has won several prestigious awards, including the US Lincoln Institute China Program International Fellowship in 2023, three academic awards for research excellence from the UKâ€™s Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) in 2019 and 2021, and HKU Research Output Prize in 2021. Moreover, I received HKU Faculty Teaching Award 2022 for my teaching dedication and innovative pedagogy. I am an associate editor of the Journal of Transport & Health.
