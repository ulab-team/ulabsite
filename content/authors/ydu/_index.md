Yao's thesis investigates causal links between public transport changes and older adults' travel behavior, social engagement, and well-being. Older people face mobility challenges, so transport modifications can impact accessibility, social connections, and well-being. She explores how interventions shape travel adaptation and how psycho-social and environmental factors mediate behavior change impacting well-being.

She applies mixed qualitative/quantitative methods using a natural experiment to compare pre/post-transport intervention differences in older adults' mobility and health. In-depth interviews aid in understanding the behavior adaptation process and pathways from changes to subjective well-being. Findings can help policy support age-friendly, healthy aging by supporting older adults' transport needs.
