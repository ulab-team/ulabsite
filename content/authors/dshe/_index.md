Dongsheng's research promotes sustainable urbanization through transportation and land use planning. In particular, his work examines strategies to increase active travel and implement transit-oriented development (TOD).

He is investigating the mechanisms of land value capture associated with TOD to reveal how municipalities can leverage such urban planning approaches to both fund expanded transit infrastructure and drive broader sustainable development objectives.
