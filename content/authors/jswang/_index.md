Jinshuo is investigating institutional frameworks structuring urban rail investments in China's Greater Bay Area. She examines how governance and financing influence transit-oriented development implementation through comparative policy analysis.

A core focus is empirically assessing the region's social and health impacts of TOD. By quantitatively evaluating lived experience indicators, Dr. Jinshuo seeks to elucidate the differential influences of integrated transport-urban planning on well-being and livability. She aims to discern effective infrastructure-urbanization coordination models to generate policy insights for sustainable urbanization.
