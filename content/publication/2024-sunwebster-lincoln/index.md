## Abstract

The metro system is an expensive transport infrastructure but has been massively built in Chinese cities. The coexistence of large-block gated communities and new metro lines has led to land use inefficiencies, low transit usage, and social inequality. This paper provides empirical evidence on the co-evolution of metro and gated communities by examining China’s recent approaches to planning and funding metro extensions. Using Guangzhou and Nanchang as cases and a mixed-methods approach, we contribute this study to the global debates on land and infrastructure governance. Our analysis reveals that gated communities and land development have mutually reinforced each other and that metro infrastructure functions are the nexus of this process. We started with empirical questions of why accessibility often takes a backseat to other priorities in the costly investments made in metro infrastructure across China. Throughout the study, we addressed crucial issues such as land value capture, land ownership, localized bargaining dynamics, and complex tensions among districts, metro companies (a municipal-level state-owned enterprise), and municipal governments. Our nuanced discussions shed light on the evolving struggles in infrastructure financing within local governments, offering a unique perspective that adds to the existing literature, which primarily focuses on national-local relations. Our findings on China’s metro infrastructure, land, and housing policies offer valuable insights into the complexities of urban development and potential avenues for policy improvements, contributing to global intellectual and policy debates.
