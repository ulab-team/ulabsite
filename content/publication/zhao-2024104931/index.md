abstract: Street experiment is a tactical urbanism practice that involves implementing
  temporary changes in street use through regulatory or physical interventions, aimed
  at people-centric street transition. During the Covid-19 pandemic, cities worldwide
  implemented street experiments to accommodate the need for socially-distanced physical
  and commercial activities. However, we know little about the locations and urban
  environments of these pandemic-induced street experiments on a global scale. This
  knowledge gap hinders us from understanding where these experiments took place,
  the conditions of the neighbourhoods involved, and the factors contributing to their
  longevity beyond the pandemic. We thus developed a geospatial database to document
  the pandemic-induced street experiments (PISE Database), enabling quantitative analysis
  of these interventions. We mapped the locations and calculated the neighbourhood
  environment attributes of 539 street experiments in 333 cities. Our contributions
  are twofold. Firstly, we enhanced the comparability of built environment indicators
  between cities, thereby advancing the construction of global geospatial datasets.
  Specifically, we established a standardised template encompassing unified neighbourhood-level
  built environment indicators and methodologies, for which we devised relative values
  to facilitate comparisons between different cities and defined study areas using
  the 15-minute walking city and Urban Centre concepts. Secondly, we conducted primary
  analyses based on spatial and temporal visualisations of the street experiment locations
  and durations, shedding light on locational patterns and development trajectories
  during times of crisis. This global, quantitative approach complements the growing
  body of local and often qualitative studies. Our work improves existing global quantitative
  databases and provides a robust foundation for future research on tactical urbanism.
