A three-dimensional pedestrian network is crucial for Hong Kong. Government authorities, international consulting firms, and urban researchers love to talk about walkability. However, when it comes to the high-density city, unfortunately, their analyses are hardly convincing. Besides miss-conceptualisations of walkability for Asian contexts, usually, from European and North American experience, they also use wrong data. Pedestrians walk on the three-dimensional (3D) networks, such as the footbridges and undergrounds. But since the city did not have such data in the past, so people use the road network as a substitute.

We built the 3D pedestrian network of Hong Kong, in three years, from 2016 to 2019. Our 3D pedestrian network model classifies segments into 23 categories with multi-height levels, such as sidewalk, footbridge, underground, crosswalk, ramp, and rooftop paths. We built the data using a geographic information system. The 3D pedestrian network is over 8000 km, which is 2.4 times in length and 8.5 times in link size greater than the road network.

### Project Outputs

- [Connecting the city: A Three-dimensional Pedestrian Network of Hong Kong]({{< ref "/publication/2019-sunwebsterzhang-epb/index" >}} "academic publication")
- [Hong Kong Pedestrian Network Open Data] (https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-landsd-openmap-3d-pedestrian-network)
  - Our network data have been transferred to Lands Department through HKU Technology Transfer Office, and released to the public in 2020 (see the [press releases] (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202012/03/P2020120300289.htm)). The accurate data empower urban analytics of the high-density city. Now we have the correct data, walkable Hong Kong and smart-city applications can do better.

Our 3D pedestrian network work has won two prestigious awards from the **Royal Town Planning Institute** (RTPI) in 2019: the early career academic award and the commendation award for research excellence.
